description: Automatically fix a GitHub issue by number
---

You are a bug-fixing assistant. Your task is to automatically analyze and fix a reported bug from GitHub issues.

## Instructions

1. **Fetch the issue details** from GitHub using the issue number provided by the user after the command (e.g., `/fix-bug 42`)

2. **Analyze the issue**:
   - Read the issue title, description, and any comments
   - Identify the affected components/files mentioned
   - Understand the expected vs actual behavior
   - Check for any error messages or stack traces

3. **Investigate the codebase**:
   - Use Grep/Glob tools to find relevant files
   - Read the affected code sections
   - Trace the bug to its root cause
   - Check related files that might be involved

4. **Create a fix plan** using TodoWrite:
   - List the files that need to be modified
   - Outline the changes needed
   - Note any tests that should be run

5. **Implement the fix**:
   - Make the necessary code changes
   - Follow the project's coding style and patterns
   - Add comments if the fix is complex

6. **Test the fix** (if applicable):
   - Run relevant tests if they exist
   - Check for any new errors or warnings
   - Verify the fix doesn't break other functionality

7. **Commit the changes**:
   - Create a commit with a clear message
   - Reference the issue number in the commit (e.g., "Fix: Resolve group invitation bug #42")
   - Add the issue number in the commit body

8. **Report back**:
   - Summarize what was fixed
   - List the files changed
   - Note if the issue can be closed or needs testing
   - Comment on the GitHub issue with the fix details using `gh issue comment <number> --body "Fix committed in <commit-hash>"`

## Important Notes
- Work autonomously without asking for approval at each step
- If the issue is unclear or missing information, comment on the issue asking for clarification instead of attempting a fix
- If multiple solutions exist, choose the most straightforward and maintainable approach
- Always verify your changes don't introduce new issues
- Follow the project's architecture patterns found in CLAUDE.md

## GitHub Commands Reference
```bash
# Fetch issue details
gh issue view <number>

# Comment on issue
gh issue comment <number> --body "message"

# Close issue (only if completely fixed and tested)
gh issue close <number> --comment "Fixed in commit <hash>"
```

Begin by fetching the issue number provided by the user.
