## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Firebase App Distribution** for quick testing before stores:
   ```bash
   firebase appdistribution:distribute build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk \
     --app FIREBASE_APP_ID \
     --groups "testers"
   ```

2. **Keep keystore safe**: Store in password manager + cloud backup

3. **Version naming**: Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0, etc.)

4. **Test on multiple devices**: Different screen sizes and OS versions

5. **Collect feedback**: Use TestFlight feedback or Google Form
